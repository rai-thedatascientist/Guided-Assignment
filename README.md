# Data Science with Python - Guided Assignments

This repository contains four guided assignments designed to help beginners learn basic Data Science concepts using Python. These assignments cover key topics such as data manipulation, basic statistics, and introductory machine learning, all using standard Python features without the use of external libraries.

## Working with Data
In this assignment, you will work with basic data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Tasks will include:
- Reading and writing data from/to text files
- Performing basic data manipulations like sorting, filtering, and aggregating

## Basic Data Visualization
In this assignment, you will learn how to create simple visualizations using basic Python techniques, such as:
- Creating bar charts and line graphs using loops and text-based outputs
- Understanding how to plot data using the `matplotlib` library (if allowed later)


## Getting Started
To get started with these assignments, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-python-guided-assignments.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd data-science-python-guided-assignments
    ```

3. Start working through the assignments by opening the respective Python files.

There are no additional installation steps, as these assignments are written in pure Python.
